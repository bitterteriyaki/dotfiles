# `bitterteriyaki/dotfiles`

This is my dotfiles repository, where I store my personal configurations for
various programs and tools I use in my development environment. These files are
essential to maintain consistency across my working environment on different
machines.

> **Disclaimer:** this is *not* a community-driven repository. It's a private
> configuration for my particular use cases. I make no guarantees that it will
> work out of the box for anyone. It may also change drastically and without
> any warning.

> bindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own
> risk.

Currently, I'm using two operating systems: a desktop with Arch Linux and an
Apple MacBook.
