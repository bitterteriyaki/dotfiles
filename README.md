# `bitterteriyaki/dotfiles`

This my personal dotfiles, where I store my personal configurations files for
some tools that I use in my development environment. I created this repository
to maintain consistency between the different machines I have.

Some dependencies are required to install dotfiles on your machine. If you,
like me, are using Arch Linux as your distro, you can run the following
command to install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
$ yay -S chezmoi
```
