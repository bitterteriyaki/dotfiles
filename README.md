# `bitterteriyaki/dotfiles`

Howdy! This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which I use to rice my
system and configure tools and applications for my environment in a consistent
way. I currently use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) tool to manage my
dotfiles, which allows me to keep my configurations in a single repository and
apply them to different machines with ease.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is **not** a community-driven repository. It's a private configuration
> for my particular cases. I make no guarantees that it will work out of the
> bot for anyone. It may also change drastically and without any warning.
